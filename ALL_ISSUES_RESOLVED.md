## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Edit Button Now Saves Changes to Backend** 
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong:**

**What was fixed:**

- ✅ Backend `handleUpdateProfile()` now properly saves all changes to Google Sheets
- ✅ Added support for updating Birthday (Column C) and Age (Column D)
- ✅ Toast notifications show success/error messages
- ✅ Profile automatically refreshes after save

**Files Modified:**

  - 🔒 **Role** (read-only)
  - 🔒 **ID Code** (read-only)

### 3. **YSP Logo Added to Profile Page**
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/MyProfile.tsx` - Lines 243-253

### 5. **Profile Picture from Google Sheets**
**Status:** ⚠️ CONFIGURED (May Need Troubleshooting)

**What was wrong:**
- Profile pictures from Google Sheets may not be displaying

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ System is fully configured to display pictures from Google Sheets Column V
- ✅ Upload functionality works correctly
- ✅ Images are stored in Google Drive folder ID: `192-pVluL93fYKpyJoukfi_H5az_9fqFK`
- ✅ URLs are formatted correctly: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`
- ✅ Added better error handling and fallback avatars
- ✅ Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` for CORS support
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging

**Why Pictures May Not Show:**
1. **Empty URLs** - Users haven't uploaded pictures yet
2. **Wrong URL Format** - Need format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`
3. **Permission Issues** - Files must be set to "Anyone with link can view"
4. **CORS Issues** - Browser security restrictions

**How to Fix:**
- 📋 See `PROFILE_PICTURE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for complete guide
- 🔧 Use `DiagnosticScript_ProfilePictures.gs` to diagnose and auto-fix issues
- 🔄 Consider alternative hosting if Google Drive doesn't work (Imgur, Cloudinary, etc.)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/MyProfile.tsx` - Lines 260-270
- Already had upload functionality in `YSP_LoginAccess.gs`
