# Profile Page Updates Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Edit Button Not Saving Changes
**Problem:** The edit button didn't actually save changes to the backend.

**Root Cause:** API mismatch - Frontend was calling `updateUserProfile` but backend function was `updateProfile`.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `src/services/api.ts` to use the correct action name `updateProfile`
- Backend now properly saves all editable fields to Google Sheets

---

### 2. ‚úÖ All Fields Now Editable (Except Position, Role, ID Code)
**Problem:** Only some fields were editable.

**Solution:**
Made the following fields editable:
- ‚úèÔ∏è Email Address
- ‚úèÔ∏è Contact Number
- ‚úèÔ∏è Birthday
- ‚úèÔ∏è Age
- ‚úèÔ∏è Gender
- ‚úèÔ∏è Pronouns
- ‚úèÔ∏è Civil Status
- ‚úèÔ∏è Religion
- ‚úèÔ∏è Nationality

**Read-Only Fields (Cannot be edited):**
- üîí Position
- üîí Role
- üîí ID Code
- üîí Username
- üîí Password (view-only with show/hide toggle)

**Backend Support:** Updated `handleUpdateProfile` in `YSP_LoginAccess.gs` to support birthday and age updates.

### 3. ‚úÖ YSP Logo Added to Profile Page
**Solution:** Added official YSP logo at the top-right corner of the profile page
- Logo URL: `https://scontent.fdvo2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/462543605_122156158186224300_6848909482214993863_n.jpg`
- Displays with rounded border and shadow
- Fallback to generated avatar if image fails to load

---

### 4. ‚úÖ YSP Logo Updated in Top Bar
**Solution:** Updated the TopBar component to use the official YSP logo instead of generic placeholder
- Same logo URL as profile page
- Consistent branding across the application

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile Picture from Google Sheets

**Current Status:** The system is already configured to display profile pictures from Google Sheets:

#### How It Works:
1. **Upload**: Users can click the camera icon on their profile picture to upload an image
2. **Storage**: Images are uploaded to Google Drive folder (ID: `192-pVluL93fYKpyJoukfi_H5az_9fqFK`)
3. **URL Format**: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id={FILE_ID}`
4. **Sheet Column**: Profile picture URLs are stored in Column V (ProfilePictureURL) of User Profiles sheet
5. **Display**: Frontend fetches and displays the URL from the sheet

#### Why Pictures May Not Show:

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **Empty URLs in Sheet**: Check if Column V has valid Google Drive URLs
2. **CORS Issues**: Google Drive links may have CORS restrictions
3. **Permission Issues**: Drive files must have "Anyone with link can view" permission
4. **Invalid URLs**: URLs must use the correct format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`

#### To Verify:
```
1. Open User Profiles sheet
2. Check Column V (ProfilePictureURL)
3. Ensure URLs are in format: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID
4. Test URL by pasting in browser - should show the image directly
```

#### Alternative Solutions if Google Drive Doesn't Work:

**Option A: Use Base64 Encoding (No External Storage)**
- Store images directly in the sheet as base64 strings
- No external dependencies
- Slower loading for large images
- Sheet size limitations

**Option B: Use Imgur or Similar Image Host**
- Upload to Imgur via their API
- More reliable CORS support
- Public image hosting
- Free tier available

**Option C: Use Cloud Storage (Firebase, AWS S3, Cloudinary)**
- More robust solution
- Better performance
- Requires setup and potential costs

#### Current Implementation Improvements:
‚úÖ Added better error handling for failed image loads
‚úÖ Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` attribute for CORS
‚úÖ Added fallback to UI Avatars if image fails
‚úÖ Added console logging to debug loading issues

## Next Steps

If profile pictures still don't show from Google Sheets:

2. Test one URL directly in browser
3. Verify Google Drive folder permissions
4. Check browser console for CORS errors
5. Consider alternative hosting (see "Alternative Solutions" above)

## Notes

- All changes are automatically saved to Google Sheets
- Changes reflect immediately in the UI
- Profile pictures require proper Google Drive setup
- YSP logo is pulled from Facebook CDN (consider hosting it locally or on Drive for reliability)
