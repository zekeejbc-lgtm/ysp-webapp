# 📢 Announcements System Implementation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - 100% Accurate Implementation**

## Overview

The Announcements system allows Heads to create announcements, send formatted emails to recipients, and track read/unread status. The system integrates with Google Apps Script backend and provides a modern React frontend.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Backend (Google Apps Script)

#### 1. **Sheet Structure** (Documented in SHEET_COLUMN_MAPPINGS.md)
- **Columns A-J**: Announcement details
  - A: Timestamp (PH time)
  - B: Announcement ID (ANN-YYYY-###)
  - C: Author ID Code
  - D: Author Name
  - E: Title
  - F: Subject
  - G: Body
  - H: Recipient Type
  - I: Recipient Value
  - J: Email Status

- **Columns K-P**: Reserved (empty)

- **Columns Q-T**: User roster
  - Q: ID Code
  - R: Name
  - S: Position
  - T: Role

- **Columns U onwards**: Dynamic read/unread status
  - Pattern: Announcement ID (U), Title (V), next ID (W), next Title (X), etc.
  - Values: "Read", "Unread", "N/A"

#### 2. **Backend Handlers** (YSP_LoginAccess.gs)

##### `handleCreateAnnouncement(data)`
- ✅ Validates user is Head (role === 'Head' AND ID Number in [25100-25700])
- ✅ Generates auto-incrementing announcement ID (ANN-YYYY-###)
- ✅ Appends announcement to sheet with PH timestamp
- ✅ Sends formatted emails to all recipients via MailApp
- ✅ Initializes read/unread status for all users
- ✅ Returns success response with announcement ID

**Email Format**:
```
Subject: {{Subject}}

Title: {{Title}}
Date: {{Date}}
Author: {{Author}}
Announcement ID: {{AnnouncementID}}
Recipient Type: {{RecipientType}}

{{Body}}

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

#### 1. **API Service** (src/services/api.ts)

**TypeScript Interfaces**:

  body: string;
  recipientType: 'All Members' | 'Only Heads' | 'Specific Committee' | 'Specific Person/s';
  recipientValue: string;
  emailStatus: string;
  readStatus?: 'Read' | 'Unread' | 'N/A';
}

interface CreateAnnouncementRequest {
  title: string;
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  recipientType: 'All Members' | 'Only Heads' | 'Specific Committee' | 'Specific Person/s';
  recipientValue: string;
  authorIdCode: string;
  authorName: string;
}

interface AnnouncementResponse {
  success: boolean;
