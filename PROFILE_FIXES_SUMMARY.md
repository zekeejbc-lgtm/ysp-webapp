# MyProfile Component Fixes - Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Username Field is Now Editable**
- **Before**: Username was displayed as read-only text
- **After**: When you click "Edit Profile", the username becomes an editable input field
- **How it works**: The field checks if `isEditing` is true and shows an input instead of plain text

### 2. **Password Field is Now Editable**
- **Before**: Password was displayed as read-only text with show/hide toggle
- **After**: When you click "Edit Profile", the password becomes an editable input field
- **How it works**: 
  - In view mode: Shows password with show/hide toggle (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ or actual password)
  - In edit mode: Shows editable text input where you can type a new password

### 3. **Save Changes Button Already Works**
- The "Save Changes" and "Cancel" buttons were already implemented in the code
- They appear when you click "Edit Profile"
- **Location**: Top-right corner of the profile card, below the YSP logo
- **Functionality**: 
  - **Save**: Calls the backend API to update your profile in Google Sheets
  - **Cancel**: Discards changes and returns to view mode

### 4. **Profile Picture Loading Improved**
- **Problem**: Google Drive URLs often have CORS (Cross-Origin) restrictions that prevent images from loading
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Removed `crossOrigin="anonymous"` attribute that was causing additional CORS issues
  - Added helper function `getDisplayableGoogleDriveUrl()` that converts Google Drive URLs to thumbnail format
  - Thumbnail format: `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=FILE_ID&sz=w400`
  - This format has fewer CORS restrictions and loads more reliably

## üîç How to Test

1. **Test Editable Fields**:
   - Click the "Edit Profile" button (top-right)
   - Try editing username, password, email, phone, birthday, age, gender, pronouns, civil status, religion, and nationality
   - Verify that Position, Role, and ID Code remain read-only
   - Click "Save" to save changes
   - Check Google Sheets to confirm changes were saved

2. **Test Profile Picture**:
   - Look at your profile picture at the top of the page
   - If you see the YSP logo or initials instead of your photo, check the console for errors
   - Click the camera icon to upload a new profile picture
   - The picture should upload and display immediately

## üö® Google Drive Profile Picture Issues

### Why Profile Pictures May Not Load:

1. **CORS Restrictions**: Google Drive has security policies that sometimes block images from loading in web apps
2. **File Permissions**: Even with "Anyone with link" sharing, Google Drive may still restrict access
3. **URL Format**: The original format `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=...` doesn't always work

### Current Solution:
The code now tries to use the thumbnail URL format which is more reliable, but Google Drive images may still have issues.

### Alternative Solutions (Choose One):

#### **Option A: Use Different Image Storage (Recommended)**
Instead of Google Drive, use:
- **Imgur**: Free image hosting with direct image URLs
- **Cloudinary**: Free tier for image hosting
- **Base64 Encoding**: Store images directly in Google Sheets as base64 strings (works for smaller images)
- **GitHub**: Store images in a public repository

#### **Option B: Make Google Drive Folder Publicly Accessible**
1. Go to the Google Drive folder: `192-pVluL93fYKpyJoukfi_H5az_9fqFK`
2. Right-click ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Change to "Anyone on the internet with this link can view"
3. Make sure individual images are also set to "Anyone with link can view"
4. This may still not work due to Google's CORS policies

#### **Option C: Use Google Drive API Proxy**
Create a backend proxy that:
1. Receives image request from frontend
2. Fetches image from Google Drive using authenticated API
3. Returns image to frontend
This bypasses CORS but requires more backend work

#### **Option D: Store URLs Differently in Google Sheets**
Instead of storing Google Drive URLs, you could:
1. Upload images to Google Drive as usual
2. Use Google Drive API to get a different URL format
3. Store that URL in the sheet instead

## üîß Testing the Fixes

### Test Edit Mode:
```
1. Log in to your profile
2. Click "Edit Profile" (top-right)
3. You should see:
   - "Save" button (green)
   - "Cancel" button (gray)
   - Input fields for username and password
4. Make changes
5. Click "Save"
6. Check if changes persist after page reload
```

### Test Profile Picture:
```
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any errors related to profile picture loading
3. Check the URL being used (should be thumbnail format now)
4. If you see CORS errors, consider alternative storage options
```

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Verify the editable fields work correctly**
2. **Test the Save/Cancel buttons**
3. **Check if profile pictures load now with the new URL format**
4. **If profile pictures still don't work, choose an alternative storage solution**
